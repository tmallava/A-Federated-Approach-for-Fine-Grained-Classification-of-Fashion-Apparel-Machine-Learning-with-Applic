Run main.ipynb file to predict the hem type, hem length and sleeve length of given dress image

To run this file two types of images are needed: original image and corresponding mask images from segnet model

Both the paths of original images and mask images and csv filenames can be changed accordingly

A small dataset is given as an example. 

This main.ipynb file predicts the given image and further saves the cropping images for neckline prediction.

Once the cropped images are saved run CNN_Neckline_Prediction.py file to predict neckline types.
