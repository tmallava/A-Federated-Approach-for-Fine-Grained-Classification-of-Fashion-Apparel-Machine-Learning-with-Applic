Run main.ipynb file to predict the hem type, hem length and sleeve length of given dress image

To run this file two types of images are needed: original image and corresponding mask images from segnet model

Both the paths of original images and mask images and csv filenames can be changed accordingly

A small dataset is uploaded under dataset folder as an example.

Threshold data for computing hem length is also uploaded as threhold_data

Once the image and corresponding mask images paths are given, Main.ipynb file predicts hem type, hem length and sleeve length for the given image
