Run main.ipynb file to predict the hem type, hem length and sleeve length of given dress image

To run this file two types of images are needed: original image and corresponding mask images from segnet model

Both the paths of original images and mask images and csv filenames can be changed accordingly

Small sample set of mask images and original images are uploaded under dataset folder as an example.

Two csv files in dataset folder represents the filenames of mask and original images.

Threshold data for computing hem length is also uploaded as threhold_data

Once the image and corresponding mask images paths are given, Main.ipynb file predicts hem type, hem length and sleeve length for the given image
